[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/77f1ee90-5361-4717-b7e2-c5f84f6db646/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/pbthang/deploys)

My personal portfolio developed with [Astro](https://astro.build), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) at [https://pbthang.netlify.app/](https://pbthang.netlify.app/).

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```txt
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                             |

| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`            |
